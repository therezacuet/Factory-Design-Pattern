# Factory-Design-Pattern
```
public interface Vehicle {
	int set_num_of_wheels();
	int set_num_of_passengers();
	boolean has_gas();
}
```
a) Explain how can you use the pattern to create car and plane class?

Answer:

I have use Factory design to solve this problem.Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but letâ€™s the classes that implement the interface decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
